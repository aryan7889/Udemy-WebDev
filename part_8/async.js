// Javascript:
// 1.=>Synchronous------------>first one line of code will be executed then other line 
//     would be executed it is the behaviour of the synchronous nature of java Script.
// 
// 2.=>Single threaded------->only one thread would be used to execute the commad and it is one of the 
// slowest language in comparison to the new language coming into the market in today world.


/*
execution context :--
=execute one line of code at a time.

=>each operation waits for the last one to complete the last one.

BLOCKING CODE AND NON BLOCKING CODE :


BLOCKING CODE:
=>Block the flow of the program.
Ex..let's say if someone say to someone to wait until he comes after taaking the water so the 
other person cant do anything around he need to only waitfor him to come.


Non Blocking Code:
here there is not blocking anything.

Lets say if you have some file to read in your ocde if you are using
the blocking code then your program cant do anything until that file is fully read
inspite of how many time it will take it to read that file while if you are using 
the non blocking code then thw file would be get read and on the other hand your 
program can also run hand to hand.




Now here most of us would be saying that the non blocking code is nice it can 
do both the work syncronisbly but problem arise when you are working with database 
as it also a file if you have enter the wrong input that database decline to 
accept that the problem arise so we need to look at what is necessary at what time.
