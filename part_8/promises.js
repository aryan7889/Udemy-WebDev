/*
Promises:
the promise object represent the eventual completion of an asynchronous 
operation and it resulting value.

Ex..Jaruri nhi hai sare kaam abhi ho , bhut sare kaam hai jo utne fat
hote hai jis speed mei programming execute hoti hai.


A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
